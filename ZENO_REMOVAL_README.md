# Zeno Removal Guide

This document provides instructions on how to resolve the persistent error related to Zeno files that have been removed from the project.

## Background

We have decided to use open-source alternatives (Streamlit) instead of Zeno for visualizing WebArena results. All Zeno-related files have been removed from the project, but VS Code's Python language server (Pylance) might still show errors related to these files due to cached information.

## Steps to Resolve the Error

### 1. Restart the Python Language Server

1. In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette
2. Type "Python: Restart Language Server" and select that command
3. Wait for the language server to restart

### 2. Reload VS Code Window

If the error persists:

1. In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette
2. Type "Developer: Reload Window" and select that command
3. Wait for VS Code to reload

### 3. Clear VS Code Caches

If the error still persists:

1. Close VS Code
2. Delete the following directories if they exist:
   - `.vscode/.pylance`
   - `.vscode/.ropeproject`
3. Restart VS Code

### 4. Configuration Files

We have already updated the following configuration files to ignore Zeno-related files:

- `.gitignore`: Added entries to ignore Zeno-related files
- `.vscode/settings.json`: Added settings to exclude Zeno-related files from the workspace
- `pyrightconfig.json`: Added settings to ignore Zeno-related files and disable the reportArgumentType check

### 5. Placeholder File

We have created a placeholder file for `webarena-zeno.ipynb` that doesn't contain the problematic code. This should prevent the error from appearing.

## Using Open-Source Visualization Tools

Instead of Zeno, we now use the following open-source tools for visualizing WebArena results:

- `webarena_dashboard.py`: A Streamlit dashboard for visualizing WebArena results
- `webarena_visualizer.py`: A Python module for visualizing WebArena results using matplotlib and other open-source libraries
