# Agent Dashboard

## Overview

The Agent Dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for monitoring and interacting with agents in the DMac system. It displays live agent data, benchmarks, performance metrics, and provides a multi-modal chat interface for direct agent interaction.

## Features

### 1. Agent Information

The dashboard displays detailed information about the agent:

- Name and description
- Status (active, inactive, training, error)
- Capabilities and expertise
- Performance metrics (tasks completed, success rate, response time)

### 2. Benchmarks

The benchmarks section shows how the agent performs with different models:

- Model comparison chart (radar chart)
- Benchmark results table
- Performance metrics across different tasks

This allows users to compare the performance of different models for the same agent and identify the best model for specific tasks.

### 3. Performance Metrics

The performance section provides detailed metrics about the agent's performance:

- Task completion status (completed, in progress, failed, pending)
- Task categories distribution
- Response time trend
- Success rate trend

These metrics help users understand how the agent is performing over time and identify areas for improvement.

### 4. Multi-Modal Chat Interface

The chat interface allows users to interact directly with the agent using different input methods:

- Text input
- Voice input
- File upload
- Canvas interaction

This bypasses the DMac orchestration layer and allows direct communication with the agent.

## Implementation

The Agent Dashboard is implemented using the following components:

### 1. Frontend

- HTML template: `templates/agent_dashboard.html`
- CSS styles: `static/css/agent_dashboard.css`
- JavaScript for charts and interactivity

### 2. Backend

- Server routes: `server.py`
- API endpoints for agent details, benchmarks, and performance metrics
- Chat message handling

### 3. API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are used by the dashboard:

- `/api/agents/<agent_id>`: Get agent details
- `/api/agents/<agent_id>/benchmarks`: Get agent benchmarks
- `/api/agents/<agent_id>/performance`: Get agent performance metrics
- `/api/agents/<agent_id>/message`: Send a message to the agent

## Navigation

The Agent Dashboard can be accessed in two ways:

1. From the Agents page by clicking the "Details" button on an agent card
2. Directly via the URL: `/agent/<agent_id>`

## Customization

The dashboard can be customized through the Settings tab, which allows users to modify:

- Model selection
- Temperature and other generation parameters
- Vision and RL capabilities
- Other agent-specific settings

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements for the Agent Dashboard include:

1. Real-time updates using WebSockets
2. More detailed performance analytics
3. Advanced visualization options
4. Integration with training and fine-tuning workflows
5. Collaborative features for team environments
