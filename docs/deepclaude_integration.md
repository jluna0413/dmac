# DeepClaude Integration

## Overview

DeepClaude is a hybrid approach that combines DeepSeek R1 with Claude 3.7 Sonnet to create a powerful system for code generation, explanation, and refactoring. This document describes how DeepClaude is integrated into the DMac system.

## How DeepClaude Works

The DeepClaude approach works by:

1. **Reasoning Generation**: Using DeepSeek R1 to generate reasoning about a problem or task
2. **Reasoning Extraction**: Extracting this reasoning from the model's output
3. **Final Generation**: Passing the reasoning to Claude 3.7 Sonnet to generate the final output

This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both models:
- DeepSeek R1's strong reasoning capabilities
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet's high-quality output generation

## Implementation

The DeepClaude integration consists of the following components:

### 1. DeepClaude Module

The core functionality is implemented in `models/deepclaude/deepclaude_module.py`. This module provides:

- A flexible interface for using the DeepClaude approach
- Support for different model combinations
- Caching for improved performance
- Methods for code generation, explanation, and refactoring

### 2. Cody Agent Integration

The Cody agent uses the DeepClaude module for its code-related tasks:

- Code generation
- Code completion
- Code explanation
- Code refactoring

The integration is implemented in `agents/cody/agent.py`.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Integration

The Cody agent tracks experiences with the DeepClaude approach and shares them with the OpenManus RL system. This allows the system to:

- Learn which approaches work best for different coding tasks
- Optimize model selection and prompting strategies
- Adapt to user preferences over time

## Configuration

The DeepClaude integration can be configured through the agent configuration file (`config/agent_config.json`). The following options are available:

```json
{
  "reasoning_model": "GandalfBaum/deepseek_r1-claude3.7:latest",
  "generation_model": "claude-3-7-sonnet",
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "supports_native_reasoning": true,
  "enable_proxy": {
    "reasoning_model": false,
    "generation_model": true
  }
}
```

## Usage

The DeepClaude module can be used by any agent in the system. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from models.deepclaude import DeepClaudeModule

# Initialize the module
deepclaude = DeepClaudeModule({
    'reasoning_model': 'GandalfBaum/deepseek_r1-claude3.7:latest',
    'generation_model': 'claude-3-7-sonnet'
})

# Generate code
result = await deepclaude.generate_code(
    prompt="Create a function to parse JSON data",
    language="python"
)

# Access the generated code and reasoning
code = result['content']
reasoning = result['reasoning']
```

## Performance

The DeepClaude approach generally outperforms single-model approaches for code-related tasks. Benchmarks show improvements in:

- Code quality
- Execution success rate
- Explanation clarity
- Refactoring effectiveness

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements for the DeepClaude integration include:

1. Support for more model combinations
2. Fine-tuning of the reasoning extraction process
3. Integration with more agents in the system
4. Advanced caching and optimization strategies
