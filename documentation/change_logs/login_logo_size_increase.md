### 3. Adjusted Spacing
- **Previous Implementation**:

## Implementation Details

### CSS Changes
```css
.auth-header .brand-logo img {
    height: 120px; /* 3x bigger: 40px * 3 = 120px */
    width: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
    margin-right: 12px;
    object-fit: contain; /* Ensure the image is fully visible */
}

    font-size: 36px; /* Increased to match the larger logo */
    font-weight: 500;
}

.auth-header {
    padding: 30px 30px 20px;
    text-align: center;
    /* Add more space for the larger logo */

}
```

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/static/img/Dmac_Logo.png">

## Visual Improvements

- The proportional increase in the brand name font size maintains visual harmony
- The additional spacing ensures the layout remains balanced

## Future Improvements
