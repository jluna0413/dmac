# Logo-Only Update

## Overview
This document details the changes made to use only the DMac logo without the accompanying text in the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed DMac Text from HTML
- **Previous Implementation**: 
  - The logo was accompanied by a span element with the text "DMac" in the side menu, navbar, and footer
  - The text was styled with the class "brand-name"

- **New Implementation**:
  - Removed the span elements containing the DMac text
  - Added the "logo-only" class to the logo images
  - Kept the logo images with increased size and better visibility

### 2. Updated CSS Styling
- **Previous Implementation**:
  - The logo was styled with a fixed height and margin-right to accommodate the text
  - The brand-name class was visible and styled with specific font properties

- **New Implementation**:
  - Added a new "logo-only" class for the logo images
  - Increased the logo height from 30px to 36px
  - Removed the right margin that was used to separate the logo from the text
  - Set the brand-name class to display: none to hide any remaining text
  - Increased the max-width from 100px to 150px to ensure the logo is fully visible

### 3. Updated Multiple CSS Files
- Updated material-theme.css to add the logo-only class and hide the brand-name
- Updated side-menu.css to adjust the logo styling in the side menu
- Updated footer.css to adjust the logo styling in the footer and hide the brand-name

## Implementation Details

</div>
```

```css
.brand-name {
    display: none; /* Hide all brand names */
}

## Visual Improvements
- The logo now stands alone without text, creating a cleaner and more modern look
- The increased size makes the logo more prominent and recognizable
- The removal of the text allows the logo to be the sole focus of the brand identity

## Future Improvements
- Consider creating different sizes of the logo for different contexts (favicon, mobile, etc.)
- Add hover effects or subtle animations to the logo for better user interaction
- Implement a preload directive for the logo to improve page load performance
