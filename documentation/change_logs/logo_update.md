# Logo Update

## Overview
This document details the changes made to update the DMac logo with a new SVG design that better represents the brand.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New SVG Logo
- **Previous Logo**: A circular logo with a gradient border and simplified "DM" letters inside
- **New Logo**: A modern, horizontal logo with "DMAC" text and motion lines representing speed and technology
- The new logo uses a blue-to-purple gradient for the motion lines and a dark navy color for the text
- The design is more professional and aligns better with the brand's identity as an AI agent swarm platform

### 2. Updated Logo Styling in CSS
- **Previous Implementation**:
```css
.brand-logo img {
    height: 30px;
    margin-right: 10px;
}
```

- **New Implementation**:
```css
.brand-logo img {
    height: 30px;
    width: auto;
    margin-right: 10px;
    object-fit: contain;
    /* Preserve aspect ratio and ensure the logo is fully visible */
    max-width: 100px;
}
```

### 3. Added Footer CSS
- Created a new CSS file `footer.css` to style the footer and its logo
- Added proper styling for the logo in the footer to ensure consistent appearance
- Included responsive design adjustments for smaller screens

### 4. Updated Base Template
- Added the new footer CSS file to the base.html template
- Ensured the logo is properly displayed in both the header and footer

## Files Changed
- `dashboard/static/img/dmac-logo.svg`: Updated with new logo design
- `dashboard/static/css/material-theme.css`: Enhanced logo styling
- `dashboard/static/css/footer.css`: Added new file for footer styling
- `dashboard/templates/base.html`: Added link to footer CSS

## Design Considerations
- The new logo is designed to be more recognizable and professional
- The horizontal format works better in the header and footer
- The motion lines represent speed, technology, and the dynamic nature of AI agents
- The color gradient from blue to purple represents the spectrum of capabilities in the platform
- The dark navy text provides good contrast and readability

## Future Improvements
- Create a square/icon version of the logo for favicon and mobile applications
- Develop a style guide for logo usage in different contexts
- Create variations for different backgrounds (light/dark mode)
- Add animation to the motion lines for interactive elements
