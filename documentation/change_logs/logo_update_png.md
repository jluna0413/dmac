# Logo Update to PNG Format

## Overview
This document details the changes made to update the DMac logo to use the new PNG logo file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Logo References
- **Previous Implementation**: 
  - The application was using an SVG file for the logo (`dmac-logo.svg`)
  - The logo was referenced in multiple places in the HTML templates

- **New Implementation**:
  - Updated all references to use the new PNG logo file (`Dmac_Logo.png`)
  - Maintained the same dimensions and styling for the logo

### 2. Updated Logo Locations
- Updated the favicon in the head section
- Updated the logo in the side menu
- Updated the logo in the navbar
- Updated the logo in the footer

## Files Changed
- `dashboard/templates/base.html`: Updated all logo references to use the new PNG file

## Implementation Details

### Logo References
The following references were updated:
- Favicon: `<link rel="icon" href="/static/img/Dmac_Logo.png">`
- Side Menu: `<img src="/static/img/Dmac_Logo.png" alt="DMac Logo">`
- Navbar: `<img src="/static/img/Dmac_Logo.png" alt="DMac Logo">`
- Footer: `<img src="/static/img/Dmac_Logo.png" alt="DMac Logo" height="24">`

### Logo File
- The new logo file (`Dmac_Logo.png`) was placed in the `dashboard/static/img/` directory
- The PNG format provides better compatibility across different browsers and devices

## Visual Improvements
- The new logo has a more professional and modern appearance
- The blue-to-purple gradient in the motion lines represents speed and technology
- The dark navy text provides good contrast and readability

## Future Improvements
- Consider creating different sizes of the logo for different contexts (favicon, mobile, etc.)
- Implement a preload directive for the logo to improve page load performance
- Create a vector version (SVG) of the logo for better scaling on high-resolution displays
