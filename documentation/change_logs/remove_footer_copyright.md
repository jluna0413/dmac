# Remove Footer Copyright and Version Information

## Overview
This document details the changes made to remove the copyright and version information from the footer section of the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Copyright and Version Information
- **Previous Implementation**: 
  - The footer contained a centered div with copyright text and version information
  - The text displayed was "&copy; 2023-2024 DMac | Version 1.0.0"

- **New Implementation**:
  - Removed the entire footer-info div containing the copyright and version information
  - Replaced it with an HTML comment to document the removal
  - The footer now only contains the chat input container

### 2. Updated Footer Structure
- **Previous Implementation**:
```html
<div class="footer-info d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center mt-2">
    <div class="text-muted small">
        <span>&copy; 2023-2024 DMac | Version 1.0.0</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

- **New Implementation**:
```html
<!-- Footer info removed as requested -->
```

## Files Changed
- `dashboard/templates/base.html`: Removed copyright and version information from the footer

## Implementation Details

### HTML Changes
- Removed the footer-info div and all its contents
- Added a comment to document the intentional removal
- Kept the container-fluid div and the footer-input-container for the chat input

### Visual Improvements
- The footer is now even cleaner and more focused solely on the chat input functionality
- Removal of the copyright text creates more vertical space for the chat interface
- The design is more streamlined and modern

## Future Considerations
- If legal requirements necessitate displaying copyright information, consider adding it to:
  - An "About" page accessible from the side menu
  - A modal dialog that appears when clicking on a "Legal" or "Info" link
  - The login or registration pages
- Consider adding a subtle visual separator between the chat input and the bottom of the page
- Ensure the footer height is optimized for mobile devices
