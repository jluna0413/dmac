# Remove Footer Logo

## Overview
This document details the changes made to remove the logo from the footer section of the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Logo from Footer
- **Previous Implementation**: 
  - The footer contained a logo image on the left side and copyright information on the right
  - The logo was displayed with the class "logo-only"

- **New Implementation**:
  - Removed the logo image from the footer completely
  - Centered the copyright information in the footer
  - Simplified the footer structure

### 2. Updated Footer Structure
- **Previous Implementation**:
```html
<div class="footer-info d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-2">
    <div class="d-flex align-items-center">
        <img src="/static/img/Dmac_Logo.png" alt="DMac Logo" height="30" class="logo-only">
    </div>
    <div class="text-muted small">
        <span>&copy; 2023-2024 DMac | Version 1.0.0</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

- **New Implementation**:
```html
<div class="footer-info d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center mt-2">
    <div class="text-muted small">
        <span>&copy; 2023-2024 DMac | Version 1.0.0</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Files Changed
- `dashboard/templates/base.html`: Removed logo from footer and centered copyright information

## Implementation Details

### HTML Changes
- Removed the div containing the logo image
- Changed the justify-content from "between" to "center" to center the copyright information
- Kept the existing copyright text and styling

### Visual Improvements
- The footer is now cleaner and more focused on the essential information
- The centered copyright text provides a more balanced look
- The removal of the logo reduces visual redundancy since it's already present in the header and side menu

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding links to important pages (About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) in the footer
- Add a subtle separator between the chat input and the footer information
- Consider adding a "Back to Top" button for longer chat sessions
