# Hot Words Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented hot word detection in the DMac chat interface, allowing users to trigger different modes automatically by using specific words or phrases in their messages. This makes the interface more intuitive and efficient by reducing the need to click buttons.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Mode Activation

- **Web Search Mode**: Triggered by words like "search", "look up", "find", etc.
- **Deep Thinking Mode**: Triggered by words like "think", "ponder", "analyze", etc.
- **Deep Research Mode**: Triggered by words like "research", "brainstorm", "investigate", etc.

### 2. Visual Feedback

- Toast notifications indicate which mode was activated
- UI elements (buttons) update to show active modes
- Thinking indicator displays the current mode

### 3. User Control

- Buttons remain available for manual activation
- Users can still choose search engines and other options
- Modes can be toggled off manually

## Technical Implementation

The implementation involved several key components:

1. **Hot Word Lists**: Defined lists of trigger words for each mode
2. **Detection Function**: Created a function to check messages for hot words
3. **Mode Activation**: Updated the toggle functions to support automatic activation
4. **Visual Feedback**: Added toast notifications and UI updates

### Code Structure

- Added hot word lists to the UnifiedInput constructor
- Created detectAndActivateHotWords function to check messages
- Created containsAnyHotWord helper function
- Updated toggleResearchMode and toggleThinkingMode to support toast notifications
- Modified the sendMessage function to check for hot words before sending

## User Experience

From the user's perspective, the experience is now more natural and conversational:

1. User types a message containing hot words (e.g., "Can you search for the latest Flutter version?")
2. System automatically detects "search" as a hot word
3. Web search mode is activated
4. A toast notification appears indicating "Web search mode activated based on your message"
5. The research button is highlighted to show it's active
6. The message is sent with web search enabled

## Benefits

1. **More Natural Interaction**: Users can trigger modes through natural language
2. **Reduced Friction**: No need to click buttons before typing a message
3. **Discoverability**: Users can discover features through normal conversation
4. **Efficiency**: Faster workflow without interrupting the thought process

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation provides a solid foundation, there are several potential enhancements:

1. **User-Customizable Hot Words**: Allow users to add or remove hot words
2. **Context-Aware Detection**: Consider message context when detecting hot words
3. **Multi-Language Support**: Add hot words in different languages
4. **Learning from Usage**: Improve detection based on user behavior
5. **More Granular Control**: Add specific hot words for different search engines or thinking modes

## Conclusion

The hot word functionality makes the DMac chat interface more intuitive and efficient by allowing users to trigger different modes through natural language. This reduces the need for manual button clicks and creates a more seamless user experience.
