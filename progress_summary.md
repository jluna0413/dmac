## Technical Debt

1. **Database Integration**
   - Currently using hardcoded data due to PostgreSQL connection issues
   - Need to implement proper database integration

2. **Code Quality**
   - Several unused imports and parameters in the codebase
   - Type checking issues in the web research API

3. **Testing**
   - Need to implement comprehensive testing for all components
   - Need to create test accounts for different user roles

## Conclusion

The DMac project is now back on track with a solid web-based implementation. The core functionality is working, and we have a clear plan for implementing the remaining features. The switch from Flutter to Python/JavaScript/HTML5/CSS has simplified the development process and will make it easier to implement the remaining features.
