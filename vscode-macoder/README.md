# MaCoder for Visual Studio Code

MaCoder is a powerful AI coding assistant with code completion functionality, inspired by Augment Code. It can work in two modes:

1. **Integrated Mode**: Connected to the DMac server for enhanced capabilities
2. **Standalone Mode**: Works completely independently without any external dependencies

## Features

- **Chat**: Get answers about your code and codebase
- **Next Edit**: Step-by-step guidance for complex changes
- **Code Completions**: Context-aware code suggestions
- **Instructions**: Use natural language to modify code
- **Autonomous Mode**: Autonomous coding assistance for complex tasks
- **Project Indexing**: Local code indexing for better context awareness
- **Brainstorming**: Generate and organize ideas for your projects
- **Roadmap Generation**: Create project roadmaps from brainstorming sessions
- **Deep Reasoning**: Perform deep reasoning on complex problems
- **Code Verification**: Verify code syntax and style
- **Enhanced Context Awareness**: Track code edits for better context
- **Multiple Model Providers**: Support for Ollama and LM Studio

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.60.0 or higher
- For integrated mode: DMac server running on http://localhost:1302 (configurable)

2. Right-click and select `MaCoder: Verify Code` or use the Command Palette
3. MaCoder will check the code for syntax and style issues
4. Issues will be displayed in the Problems panel

### Enhanced Context Awareness

1. MaCoder automatically tracks your code edits to provide better context
2. You can manage edit sessions to organize related changes:
   - Use `MaCoder: Start New Edit Session` to start a new session
   - Use `MaCoder: End Current Edit Session` to end the current session
3. Edit sessions help MaCoder understand the context of your changes

### Sandbox Testing and Debugging

1. Open the Sandbox Panel with `MaCoder: Show Sandbox Panel`
2. Execute code directly in the sandbox or select code and use `MaCoder: Execute Code in Sandbox`
3. Create and save test cases for repeated testing
4. View execution results including output and errors

### Switching Model Providers

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type `MaCoder: Switch Local Model Provider`
3. Select the provider you want to use (Ollama or LM Studio)

## Known Issues

### Integrated Mode
- Requires a running DMac server
- Some features may be limited if the DMac server is not fully configured

### Standalone Mode
- Requires a local LLM provider (Ollama or LM Studio)
- Performance depends on your local hardware
- Some advanced features may be limited compared to integrated mode

### Project Indexing
- Initial indexing may take time for large projects
- Some file types might not be properly indexed
- Memory usage increases with project size

### Autonomous Mode
- Complex tasks may not be completed successfully
- Task parsing may sometimes fail with ambiguous instructions
- Task execution might timeout for very large operations

### Brainstorming
- Generated ideas quality depends on the model used
- Roadmap generation may not capture all dependencies correctly
- Storage is local and not synchronized across devices

### Deep Reasoning
- Analysis quality depends on the model used
- Complex problems may require multiple reasoning chains
- Reasoning steps may sometimes be incomplete or imprecise

### Code Verification
- Verification quality depends on the model used
- Some language-specific issues may not be detected
- Line and column numbers may not always be accurate

### Enhanced Context Awareness
- Large edit sessions may impact performance
- Some complex refactorings may not be tracked accurately
- Edit sessions are stored locally and not synchronized across devices

### Sandbox Testing and Debugging
- Execution environment is limited to installed tools and languages
- Some languages may require additional setup
- Execution time is limited to prevent infinite loops
- Sandbox is isolated but not completely secure for malicious code

### General
- Code completions may be slow for large files
- Next Edit may not work well for complex changes
